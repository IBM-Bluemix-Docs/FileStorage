# Snapshots

Snapshots are a feature of {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full}}. A snapshot represents a volume's contents at a particular point in time. Snapshots enable you to protect your data with no performance impact, minimal consumption of space, and are considered your first line of defense for data protection. Data can be easily and quickly restored from a snapshot copy if a user accidently modifies or deletes crucial data from a volume with the snapshot feature.

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} provides you with two ways to take your snapshots – through a configurable snapshot schedule that creates and deletes snapshot copies automatically for each storage volume. You can also create additional snapshot schedules, manually delete copies, and manage schedules based on your requirements. The second way is to take a manual snapshot.

A snapshot copy is a read-only image of a {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volume, that captures the state of the volume at a point in time. Snapshot copies are extremely efficient both in the time needed to create them and in storage space. A {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} snapshot copy takes only a few seconds to create - typically less than 1 second, regardless of the size of the volume or the level of activity on the storage. After a snapshot copy has been created, changes to data objects are reflected in updates to the current version of the objects, as if Snapshot copies did not exist. Meanwhile, the copy of the data remains completely stable. 

A Snapshot copy incurs no performance overhead; users can easily store up to 50 scheduled snapshots and 50 manual snapshots per {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume, all of which are accessible as read-only and online versions of the data.

Snapshots let users

- Non-disruptively create point-in-time recovery points
- Revert volumes to previous points-in-time
- You must purchase some amount of snapshot space for your volume in order to take snapshots of it. The snapshot space can be added during initial volume ordering or after initial provisioning via volume Details page and clicking the Actions drop-down button, and select Add Snapshot Space. Be aware that scheduled and manual snapshots share the snapshot space, so order your space accordingly. See the [Ordering Snapshots](ordering-snapshots.html) article for more details and guidance.

## Snapshot Best Practices
Snapshot design depends on the customer’s environment. The following design considerations will help you to plan and implement Snapshot copies: 
- 	Up to 50 snapshots can be created via schedule and up to 50 manually on each volume or LUN. 
- 	Do not over snap. Make sure that your scheduled snapshot frequency meets your RTO and RPO needs as well as your application business requirements by scheduling hourly, daily or weekly snapshots. 
- 	Snapshot AutoDelete should be used to control the growth of storage consumption. <br/>
    **Note**: the AutoDelete threshold is fixed at 95%.
    
## How do Snapshot Copies Consume Disk Space?
Snapshot copies minimize disk consumption by preserving individual blocks rather than whole files. Snapshot copies begin to consume extra space only when files in the active file system are changed or deleted. When this happens, the original file blocks are still preserved as part of one or more Snapshot copies.
In the active file system, the changed blocks are rewritten to different locations on the disk or removed as active file blocks entirely. As a result, in addition to the disk space used by blocks in the modified active file system, disk space used by the original blocks is still reserved to reflect the status of the active file system before the change.

        <td style="border: 0.0px;">After a Snapshot copy is created, the active file system and Snapshot copy point to the same disk blocks. The Snapshot copy does not use extra disk space.</td>
        <td style="border: 0.0px;">After <i>myfile.txt</i> is deleted from the active file system, the Snapshot copy still includes the file and references its disk blocks. That is why deleting active file system data does not always free up disk space.</td>
