# Ordering Snapshots

To create snapshots of your storage volume, either automated or manually, you need to purchase space to hold them. You can purchase capacity up to your storage volume amount (during the initial volume purchase or later using these steps).

1. Access your Storage through **Storage** > **{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}}** tab of the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}
2. In the **Snapshots** frame, click **Add Snapshot Space*.
3. In the **Snapshots** frame, click **Purchase snapshot space now**.
3. Select the amount of space you need.
4. Click **Continue**.
5. Enter any Promo Code you have and click **Recalculate**. The **Charges for this order** and **Order Review** have default values.
6. Click the **I have read the Master Service Agreementâ€¦** check box and click **Place Order**. Your snapshot space will be provisioned in a few minutes.

## How to Determine How Much Snapshot Space to Order

Unfortunately, there isn't a best practice so much as a best recommendation based on application. Generically speaking, snapshot space is used by snapshots based on two key pieces of information:
- how much change your active file system has, and 
- how long you plan to retain snapshots.  

Essentially, the way to calculate the amount of space needed is **(Rate of Change)** x **(number of hours/days/weeks/months retained)**.  
**Note**: The very first snapshot uses a negligible amount of space as it's just a copy of the metadata (pointers) indicating the active file system blocks. 

A volume with a lot of data change (for example, a high change rate database) and a lengthy snapshot retention period is going to need more space for snapshots than a volume with moderate change rate (for example, a VM datastore) and a more moderate snapshot retention schedule. 

If you were to take 12 hourly snapshots of a volume that holds 500 GB of actual data, and saw 1 percent of change between each snapshot, you would end up using 60 GB for snapshots.

*(5 GB Rate of Change) x (12 hourly snapshots) = 60 GB*

Conversely, if that 500 GB of actual data, with 12 hourly snapshots, saw 10 percent of change every hour, you would end up using 600 GB.

*(50 GB Rate of Change) x (12 hourly snapshots) = 600 GB*

So when determining how much Snapshot space you need, consider the rate of change carefully. It's a huge influence on how much snapshot space you need.  While the size of a volume is likely going to mean a higher amount of change, a 500 GB volume with 5 GB of change and a 10 TB volume with 5 GB of change would result in the same snapshot space usage.

Additionally, for most workloads, the larger a volume is the less space needs to be set aside initially for snapshots.  This is primarily due to the underlying data efficiencies of our platform, and the nature of how snapshots work in our environment.
