{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} is introducing a new version of {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full}}! The new storage is available in select data centers, and is backed by flash storage at higher IOPS levels with disk-level encryption for data-at-rest. All storage ordered in the select data centers is automatically created with the new version of {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}}.

**Note:** The NFS mount point for new volumes has changed. See **New mount point for enhanced {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volumes** section for details.

The new {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} is available in following regions/data centers with more data center availability added later!

The new storage has the following features and capabilities:

- [Provider-managed encryption for data-at-rest](block-file-storage-encryption-rest.html). <br/> All {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volumes are automatically provisioned as encrypted at no additional charge.
- 10 IOPS per GB tier option. <br/> A new tier was added to the Endurance type {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} to support the most demanding workloads.
- All flash-backed storage. <br/> {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} that is provisioned with either Endurance or Performance options at 2 IOPS per GB or higher is backed by all-flash storage.
- Snapshot and Replication support.
- Hourly Billing option added for storage that is planned to be used for less than a full month.
- Up to 48,000 IOPS for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} provisioned with the Performance type.
- IOPS rates are adjustable to improve performance of seasonal load changes. Read more about this feature [here](adjustable-iops.html).
- Create a clone of your data with the [{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} Volume Duplication feature](how-to-create-duplicate-volume.html).
- Storage is expandable in GB increments up to 12 TB immediately, without the need to create a duplicate or manually moving data to a larger volume. Read more about this feature [here](expandable_file_storage.html).

## New mount point for enhanced {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volumes

All enhanced {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volumes that are provisioned in these data centers have a different mount point than non-encrypted volumes. To ensure you're using the correct mount point for both your storage volumes, you can view the mount point information in the **Volume Details** page in the UI. You can also access the correct mount point through an API call:Â `SoftLayer_Network_Storage::getNetworkMountAddress()`.
