## New Mount Point for Encrypted {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} Volumes

All encrypted {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volumes provisioned in these data centers have a different mount point than non-encrypted volumes.  To ensure you're using the correct mount point for both your encrypted and non-encrypted file storage volumes, you can view the mount point information in the **Volume Details** page in the UI and access the correct mount point through an API call:Â `SoftLayer_Network_Storage::getNetworkMountAddress()`.

Check back here to see when additional data centers have been upgraded and for new features and capabilities that are being added for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}}.
