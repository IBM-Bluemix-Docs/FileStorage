# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full_notm}}

The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a system administrator or dev ops engineer would want to use this infrasturcture offering or service.
Briefly mention what the user's learning goal is and include the following SEO keywords in the title and/or the short description: IBM Cloud, ServiceName. Be sure to use conversational style. For more details, see the guidance on conversational style in the Carbon Design System at http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general.

Example: 
When resource demands spike, you need cloud infrastructure services that can scale out to meet those new requirements immediately, with control. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Virtual Servers can be deployed in a matter of minutes from virtual server images of your choice, in the geographic region that makes sense for your workloads. As soon as your workloads subside, those virtual servers can be suspended or powered down so that your cloud environment perfectly fits your infrastructure needs.

The task section includes steps to get a device, storage, or networking up and running.
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the infrastructure service.
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service.
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info. Info about VCAP service info, here: https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/vcapsvc.html
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

## Prerequisites
Before an administrator can provision or manage their infrastructure offerings, the administrator must have an upgraded {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account. For more information, see [Upgrading and unifying {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and SoftLayer billing accounts](../docs/admin/softlayerlink.html).

## Task-oriented title and description
To get up and running quickly with this infrastructure service, follow these steps: -OR-
Complete these steps to get started with the Block Storage service:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples:
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.
 -->

1. Step 1 to set up the service.
2. Step 2 to set up the service.

	```
	Copyable example for this step.
	This example might be multiline code
	to copy into a file.
	When displayed in the doc framework,
	it will have a copy button on the right.
	The user can click to copy the example
	so they can paste it into their code editor.
	```
	{: codeblock}

3. Step 3. In this step, we have a single line command example. When displayed by the doc framework, it will have a $ shown at the beginning of the line, and a copy button on the right. The copy button will copy the command but not the $.

	```
	my command -and -options
	```
	{: pre}

4. Step 4
	```
	This is a bunch of output from
		a command or program I ran
			and it can run lots of lines
			and the doc framework will show it as
			output with no copy button.
	```
	{: screen}
