# Setting up Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) for VMware Environments with {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}}

You can configure a Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) appliance for high availability (HA) configuration within a VMware environment that uses {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full}}. Use the following information along with the [Advanced Single-Site VMware Reference Architecture](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/virtualization/advanced-single-site-vmware-reference-architecturesoftlayer.html){:new_window} to set up one of these storage options in your VMware environment.

The Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) gateway serves as a gateway and router for your environment and contain zones that consist of subnets. Firewall rules are set in place between zones so they can communicate with each other. For those zones that don’t need to communicate with other zones, no firewall rule is needed.

In our example configuration, five zones are created in the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta):

- SLSERVICE – {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} services
- VMACCESS – {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers_short}} (VMs) on the capacity cluster
- MGMT – Management and capacity clusters as well as management VMs
- STORAGE – Storage server or servers
- OUTSIDE – Public internet access


Figure 1 describes the communication between each zone. Your environment might be different and might require different zones and firewall rules.

## Configuring Brocade vRouter (Vyatta)

1. SSH into the appliance with the root password that is found on the Device Details screen.
2. Type `configure` to enter the configuration mode and follow the steps in the subsequent sections.

### Setting up Interfaces

Next, the bond interfaces on both Brocade vRouters (Vyatta) are linked to the subnets in the environment. Remember to replace the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} VLANs (1101, 1102, and 1103) with the corresponding VLANs in your environment. Also, the instructions that show `<>` must be replaced with your environment’s details (with the `<>` removed).

Use the following commands to configure the bond interfaces on the Brocade vRouters (Vyatta). You must be in configure mode.

### Configuring SNAT for External Access

In this step, SNAT is configured so that management VMs and VMs on the capacity cluster can access the internet. From this step forward, configuration needs to be done on only one Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) since the setup is going to be synced later.

Use the following commands in configure mode:
```
set nat source rule 10
set nat source rule 10 source address ##.###.###.###/## (Portable Private Subnet VLAN1101/Management VMs)
set nat source rule 10 translation address ##.###.###.### (Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) bond1 IP)
set nat source rule 10 outbound-interface bond1
set nat source rule 20
set nat source rule 20 source address ##.###.###.###/## (Portable Private Subnet VLAN1103/Virtual Machines)
set nat source rule 20 translation address ##.###.###.### (Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) bond1 IP)
set nat source rule 20 outbound-interface bond1
commit
save
```


### Configuring Firewall Groups

Next, it's time to configure the firewall groups that are associated with certain IP ranges.

Use the following commands in configure mode:
```
set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES
set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.128.0/19
set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.0.86.0/24
set firewall group network-group SLSERVICES network 10.1.176.0/24

set firewall group address-group PERFORMANCEENDURANCE address '##.###.###.###' (Performance/Endurance Secondary IP)

```

### Configuring Firewall Name Rules

Now define the firewall rules for each direction of traffic. Use the following commands in configure mode:

```
set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE
set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE default-action drop
set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE rule 10 action accept
set firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE rule 10 protocol all

commit
save
```

### Configuring Zone Bindings

In this step, particular zones are bound to interfaces on the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).

Use the following commands in configure mode:
```
set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE description “Internet Zone”
set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE default-action drop
set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE interface bond1
set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE description “SoftLayer Services”
set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE default-action drop
set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE interface bond0
set zone-policy zone MGMT description “Management VMs & ESX Host Access”
set zone-policy zone MGMT default-action drop
set zone-policy zone MGMT interface bond0.1101
set zone-policy zone STORAGE description “Storage”
set zone-policy zone STORAGE default-action drop
set zone-policy zone STORAGE interface bond0.1102
set zone-policy zone VMACCESS description “VM Access”
set zone-policy zone VMACCESS default-action drop
set zone-policy zone VMACCESS interface bond0.1103
commit
save
```

### Applying Firewall Rules to Zones

Apply the firewall rules to the communication between zones. Use the following commands in configure mode:

```
set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE from MGMT firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE
set zone-policy zone OUTSIDE from VMACCESS firewall name INSIDE2OUTSIDE
set zone-policy zone VMACCESS from OUTSIDE firewall name OUTSIDE2INSIDE
set zone-policy zone VMACCESS from SLSERVICE firewall name SLSERVICE2INSIDE
set zone-policy zone MGMT from OUTSIDE firewall name OUTSIDE2INSIDE
set zone-policy zone MGMT from SLSERVICE firewall name SLSERVICE2INSIDE
set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE from MGMT firewall name INSIDE2SLSERVICE
set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE from VMACCESS firewall name INSIDE2SLSERVICE
set zone-policy zone SLSERVICE from STORAGE firewall name INSIDE2SLSERVICE
set zone-policy zone STORAGE from SLSERVICE firewall name SLSERVICE2INSIDE
set zone-policy zone STORAGE from MGMT firewall name MGMT2STORAGE
commit
save
```

### Syncing with other Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) in the HA Pair

One of the Brocade vRouter’s (Vyatta) in the HA pair is now set up, and you must sync the changes to the other gateway device.

Use the following commands in configure mode:
```
set system config-sync remote-router <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) IP> password <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) PASSWORD>
set system config-sync remote-router <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) IP> sync-map 'SYNC'
set system config-sync remote-router <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) IP> username <OTHER BROCADE VROUTER (VYATTA) USERNAME>
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 1 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 1 location 'nat'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 2 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 2 location 'firewall'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 3 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 3 location 'vpn'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 4 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 4 location 'interfaces tunnel'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 5 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 5 location 'firewall'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 6 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 6 location 'zone-policy'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 7 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 7 location 'vpn'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 8 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 8 location 'protocols static route'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 9 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 9 location 'protocols static table'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 10 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 10 location 'policy route'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 11 action 'include'
set system config-sync sync-map SYNC rule 11 location 'nat'
commit
save
```

### Associating and Route VLANs

When the zones and firewall rules are set up on the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta), you must associate the VLANs to it and enable routing of the VLANs through the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} and click **Network > Gateway Appliance** and click the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta).
2. Select a **VLAN** and click **Associate**.
4. Locate the VLANs under **Associated VLANs** and check the box next to each one.
5. Click **Bulk Actions** drop–down menu and select **Route**.
6. Click **OK**.

Your VLANs are routed through the Brocade vRouter (Vyatta). If you notice that communication is hindered between two zones, bypass the particular VLAN or VLANs in question and check your Brocade vRouter (Vyatta) settings.
