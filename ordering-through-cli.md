# Ordering {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} through the SL CLI

You can use the SL CLI to place orders for products that are normally ordered through the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. In the SL API, an order can consist of multiple order containers. The order CLI works with one order container only.

For more information about how to install and use the SL CLI, see [Python API Client](https://softlayer-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html){:new_window}.
{:tip}

## Searching for available {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} offers

The first component to look for when you place an order is a package. Packages are divided among the different top-level products that are available for ordering in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}}. Some example packages are CLOUD_SERVER for VSIs, BARE_METAL_SERVER for bare metal servers, and STORAGE_AS_A_SERVICE_STAAS for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}.

Within a package, some items are subdivided into categories. Some packages have presets for your convenience and others require items to be specified individually. If a package's category is required, an item from that category must be chosen to order the package. Depending on the category, some items within the category can be mutually exclusive.

Each order must have an associated location (data center). When you order {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}}, make sure that it is provisioned in the same location as your compute instances.
{:important}

You can use the `slcli order package-list` command to find the package you want to order. A `â€“keyword` option is provided to perform simple searching and filtering. This option makes it easier to find the package you need. Look for `Storage-as-a-Service Package 759`.

```
$ slcli order package-list --help
Usage: slcli order package-list [OPTIONS]

  List packages that can be ordered via the placeOrder API.

  Example:
      # List out all packages for ordering
      slcli order package-list

  Keywords can also be used for some simple filtering functionality to help
  find a package easier.

  Example:
     # List out all packages with "server" in the name
      slcli order package-list --keyword server

Options:
  --keyword TEXT  A word (or string) used to filter package names.
  -h, --help      Show this message and exit.
```

You can also use the `slcli file volume-order` command.

```
# slcli file volume-order --help
Usage: slcli file volume-order [OPTIONS]

  Order a file storage volume.

Options:
  --storage-type [performance|endurance]
                                  Type of file storage volume  [required]

                                  [required for storage-type endurance]
  --location TEXT                 Datacenter short name (e.g.: dal09)
                                  [required]

                                  specifies the size (in GB) of snapshot space
                                  to order

## Placing the order

The following example shows how to order a 10-GB {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volume with 100 IOPS per GB.

```
# slcli file volume-order --storage-type performance --size 20 --location dal10 --iops 100

> Storage as a Service
> File Storage
> 20 GBs
> 100 IOPS
```

By default, you can provision a combined total of 250 {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} volumes. To increase the number of your volumes, contact your sales representative. For more information about increasing limits, see [Managing Storage limits](managing-storage-limits.html).
