# Managing Storage Limits

By default, you can provision a combined total of 250 {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full}} volumes globally. 

You can request a limit increase by submitting a ticket in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. When the request is approved, it will result in a volume limit that is set for a specific data center.  

To request a limit update or increase, open a ticket and direct it to your sales representative.

In the ticket, provide the following information:

- **Ticket Subject**: Request to increase Data Center Volume Count Storage Limit

- **What is the use case for the additional volumes request?** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to a new VMWare Datastore, a new Dev/Test environment, an SQL database or logging.*

- **How many additional Block volumes are needed by type, size, IOPS, and location?** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to "25x Endurance 2 TB @ 4 IOPS in DAL09" or "25x Performance 4 TB @ 2 IOPS in WDC04".*

- **How many additional File volumes are needed by type, size, IOPS, and location?** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to "25x Performance 20 GB @ 10 IOPS in DAL09" or "50x Endurance 2 TB @ 0.25 IOPS in SJC03".*
 
- **Provide an estimate of when you expect to have provisioned all of the requested volume increase.** <br />
 "*For example, your answer might be something similar to "90 days".*

- **Provide a 90-day forecast of expected average capacity usage of these volumes.** <br />
*For example, your answer might be something similar to "expect 25 percent used in 30 days, 50% utilized in 60 days and 75 percent used in 90 days".*

A response to all of the above questions is required. You'll be notified of the update to your limits through the ticket process.
